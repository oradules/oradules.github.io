Experiments in both vertebrates and invertebrates have illustrated the
  competitive nature of growth and led to the idea that competition is a
  mechanism of regulating organ and tissue size. We have assessed
  competitive interactions between cells in a developing organ and examined
  their effect on its final size. We show that local expression of the
  Drosophila growth regulator dMyc, a homolog of the c-myc protooncogene,
  induces cell competition and leads to the death of nearby wild-type cells
  in developing wings. We demonstrate that cell competition is executed via
  induction of the proapoptotic gene hid and that both competition and hid
  function are required for the wing to reach an appropriate size when dMyc
  is expressed. Moreover, we provide evidence that reproducible wing size
  during normal development requires apoptosis. Modulating dmyc levels to
  create cell competition and hid-dependent cell death may be a mechanism
  used during normal development to control organ size.

Growth and specification of the eye are controlled independently by Eyegone
  and Eyeless in Drosophila melanogaster.

Control of growth determines the size and shape of organs. Localized
  signals known as 'organizers' and members of the Pax family of proto
  -oncogenes are both elements in this control. Pax proteins have a
  conserved DNA-binding paired domain, which is presumed to be essential for
  their oncogenic activity. We present evidence that the organizing signal
  Notch does not promote growth in eyes of D. melanogaster through either
  Eyeless (Ey) or Twin of eyeless (Toy), the two Pax6 transcription factors.
  Instead, it acts through Eyegone (Eyg), which has a truncated paired
  domain, consisting of only the C-terminal subregion. In humans and mice,
  the sole PAX6 gene produces the isoform PAX6(5a) by alternative splicing;
  like Eyegone, this isoform binds DNA though the C terminus of the paired
  domain. Overexpression of human PAX6(5a) induces strong overgrowth in
  vivo, whereas the canonical PAX6 variant hardly effects growth. These
  results show that growth and eye specification are subject to independent
  control and explain hyperplasia in a new way.

What is a role of the morphogens gradients in development?

0035-6050

The core idea of the gradient theory, a paradigm for developmental biology,
  is that biological morphogensis is based on a gradient-like distribution
  of a certain substance and its subsequent interpretation. This is an
  attempt at systematic criticism of this theory: I will argue that the
  experimental results do not support its core idea. Crucial in this context
  are the global reactions of an embryonic tissue upon chemical, genetic and
  mechanical manipulation and the possibility of regulation of the global
  and local events including redistribution of morphogens and de novo
  formation of the gene expression pattern. In addition to this, the
  possibility of other mechanisms should be explored.

Wingless promotes cell survival but constrains growth during Drosophila

During animal development, organs grow to a fixed size and shape. Organ
  development typically begins with a rapid growth phase followed by a
  gradual decline in growth rate as the organ matures, but the regulation of
  either stage of growth remains unclear. The Wnt/Wingless (Wg) proteins are
  critical for patterning most animal organs, have diverse effects on
  development and have been proposed to promote organ growth. Here we report
  that contrary to this view, Wg activity actually constrains wing growth
  during Drosophila melanogaster wing development. In addition, we
  demonstrate that Wg is required for wing cell survival, particularly
  during the rapid growth phase of wing development. We propose that the
  cell-survival- and growth-constraining activities of Wg function to sculpt
  and delimit final wing size as part of its overall patterning programme.

Regulation of the mitosis/meiosis decision in the Caenorhabditis elegans

During the development of multicellular organisms, the processes of growth
  and differentiation are kept in balance to generate and maintain tissues
  and organs of the correct size, shape and cellular composition. We have
  investigated the molecular controls of growth and differentiation in the
  Caenorhabditis elegans germline. A single somatic cell, called the distal
  tip cell, promotes mitotic proliferation in the adjacent germline by GLP
  -1/Notch signalling. Within the germline, the decisions between mitosis
  and meiosis and between spermatogenesis and oogenesis are controlled by a
  group of conserved RNA regulators. FBF, a member of the PUF (for Pumilio
  and FBF) family of RNA-binding proteins, promotes mitosis by repressing
  gld-1 mRNA activity; the GLD-1, GLD-2, GLD-3 and NOS-3 proteins promote
  entry into meiosis by regulating mRNAs that remain unknown. The regulatory
  balance between opposing FBF and GLD activities is crucial for controlling
  the extent of germline proliferation. PUF proteins regulate germline stem
  cells in both Drosophila and C. elegans and are localized to germline stem
  cells of the mammalian testis. Therefore, this post-transcriptional
  regulatory switch may be an ancient mechanism for controlling maintenance
  of stem cells versus differentiation.

Body building: regulation of shape and size by PI3K/TOR signaling during

Growth of organisms and their constituent parts responds to both intrinsic
  and extrinsic cues during development: organisms of a given species
  generally grow at a predictable rate and to a specific body size, but
  individuals can modify this program during development in response to
  environmental conditions. Recent experiments, using gene knockouts and
  targeted overexpression, have revealed the central role of a signaling
  network controlled by the PI3K and TOR kinases in this regulation. These
  signaling molecules control growth by coordinately regulating a large
  number of cell biological processes. This review focuses on the cellular
  activities regulated by PI3K and TOR during development, and discusses how
  changes in different aspects of cellular metabolism may interact to
  regulate growth. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Unsolved Problems of Intracellular Noise

Many molecules are present at so low numbers per cell that significant
  fluctuations arise spontaneously. Such <single high-reversed-9 quotation
  mark>noise<right single quotation mark> can randomize developmental
  pathways, disrupt cell cycle control or force metabolites away from their
  optimal levels. It can also be exploited for non-genetic individuality or,
  surprisingly, for more reliable and deterministic control. However, in
  spite of the mechanistic and evolutionary significance of noise, both
  explicit modeling and implicit verbal reasoning in molecular biology are
  completely dominated by macroscopic kinetics. Here I discuss some
  particularly under-addressed issues of noise in genetic and metabolic
  networks: 1) relations between systematic macro- and mesoscopic
  approaches; 2) order and disorder in gene expression; 3) autorepression
  for checking fluctuations; 4) noise suppression by noise; 5) phase
  -transitions in metabolic systems; 6) effects of cell growth and division;
  and 7) mono- and bistable bimodal switches. <Copyright> 2003 American

The functions of insulin signaling: size isn't everything, even in
  Drosophila
GOBERDHAN-Deborah-C-I; WILSON-Clive
Differentiation-London. 2003; 71 (7) : 375-397
0301-4681

English
Mammalian insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) signal through
  several receptors with different ligand specificities to regulate
  metabolism and growth. This regulation is defective in diabetes and in a
  wide variety of human tumors. Recent analysis in Drosophila melanogaster
  has revealed that insulin-like molecules (known as DILPs in flies) also
  control growth and metabolism, but probably do so by signaling through a
  single insulin receptor (InR). The intracellular signaling molecules
  regulated by this receptor are highly evolutionarily conserved. Work in
  flies has helped to dissect the network of InR-regulated intracellular
  signaling pathways and identify some of the critical players in these
  pathways and in interacting signaling cascades. Surprisingly, these
  studies have shown that DILPs control tissue and body growth primarily by
  regulating cell growth and cell size. Changes in cell growth produced by
  these molecules may subsequently modulate the rate of cell proliferation
  in a cell type-specific fashion. At least part of this growth effect is
  mediated by two small groups of neurons in the Drosophila brain, which
  secrete DILPs into the circulatory system at levels that are modulated by
  nutrition. This signaling center is also involved in DILP-dependent
  control of the fly's rate of development, fertility, and life span. These
  surprisingly diverse functions of InR signaling, which appear to be
  conserved in all higher animals, reflect a central role for this pathway
  in coordinating development, physiology, and properly proportioned growth
  of the organism in response to its nutritional state. Studies in flies are
  providing important new insights into the biology of this system, and the
  identification of novel components in the InR-regulated signaling cascade
  is already beginning to inform the development of new therapeutic
  strategies for insulin-linked diseases in the clinic.

It takes guts: the Drosophila hindgut as a model system for organogenesis.
Lengyel,-J-A; Iwaki,-D-D
Dev-Biol. 2002 Mar 1; 243(1): 1-19
Developmental-biology
0012-1606
English
The Drosophila hindgut is fruitful territory for investigation of events
  common to many types of organogenesis. The development of the Drosophila
  hindgut provides, in microcosm, a genetic model system for studying
  processes such as establishment (patterning) of an epithelial primordium,
  its internalization by gastrulation, development of left--right asymmetric
  looping, patterning in both the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes,
  innervation, investment of an epithelium with mesoderm, reciprocal
  epitheliomesenchymal interactions, cell shape change, and cell
  rearrangement. We review the genetic control of these processes during
  development of the Drosophila hindgut, and compare these to related
  processes in other bilaterians, particularly vertebrates. We propose that
  caudal/Cdx, brachyenteron/Brachyury, fork head/HNF-3, and wingless/Wnt
  constitute a conserved "cassette" of genes expressed in the blastopore and
  later in the gut, involved in posterior patterning, cell rearrangement,
  and gut maintenance. Elongation of the internalized Drosophila hindgut
  primordium is similar to elongation of the archenteron and also of the
  entire embryonic axis (both during and after gastrulation), as well as of
  various tubules (e.g., nephric ducts, Malpighian tubules), as it is driven
  by cell rearrangement. The genes drumstick, bowl, and lines (which encode
  putative transcriptional regulators) are required for this cell
  rearrangement, as well as for spatially localized gene expression required
  to establish the three morphologically distinct subregions of the hindgut.
  Expression of signaling molecules regulated by drumstick, bowl, and lines,
  in particular of the JAK/STAT activator Unpaired at the hindgut anterior,
  may play a role in controlling hindgut cell rearrangement. Other cell
  signaling molecules expressed in the hindgut epithelium are required to
  establish its normal size (Dpp and Hh), and to establish and maintain the
  hindgut visceral mesoderm (Wg and Hh). Both maternal gene activity and
  zygotic gene activity are required for asymmetric left--right looping of
  the hindgut. Some of the same genes (caudal and brachyenteron) required
  for embryonic hindgut development also act during pupation to construct a
  new hindgut from imaginal cells. Application of the plethora of genetic
  techniques available in Drosophila, including forward genetic screens,
  should identify additional genes controlling hindgut development and thus
  shed light on a variety of common morphogenetic processes. (C)2002

Shaping the vertebrate body plan by polarized embryonic cell movements.
Keller,-R

Science-
1095-9203
English
Polarized cell movements shape the major features of the vertebrate body
  plan during development. The head-to-tail body axis of vertebrates is
  elongated in embryonic stages by "convergent extension" tissue movements.
  During these movements cells intercalate between one another transverse to
  the elongating body axis to form a narrower, longer array. Recent
  discoveries show that these polarized cell movements are controlled by
  homologs of genes that control the polarity of epithelial cells in the
  developing wing and eye of the fruit fly, Drosophila.

Neurulation occurs during the early embryogenesis of chordates, and it
  results in the formation of the neural tube, a dorsal hollow nerve cord
  that constitutes the rudiment of the entire adult central nervous system.
  The goal of studies on neurulation is to understand its tissue, cellular
  and molecular basis, as well as how neurulation is perturbed during the
  formation of neural tube defects. The tissue basis of neurulation consists
  of a series of coordinated morphogenetic movements within the primitive
  streak (e.g., regression of Hensen's node) and nascent primary germ layers
  formed during gastrulation. Signaling occurs between Hensen's node and the
  nascent ectoderm, initiating neurulation by inducing the neural plate
  (i.e., actually, by suppressing development of the epidermal ectoderm).
  Tissue movements subsequently result in shaping and bending of the neural
  plate and closure of the neural groove. The cellular basis of the tissue
  movements of neurulation consists of changes in the behavior of the
  constituent cells; namely, changes in cell number, position, shape, size
  and adhesion. Neurulation, like any morphogenetic event, occurs within the
  milieu of generic biophysical determinants of form present in all living
  tissues. Such forces govern and to some degree control morphogenesis in a
  tissue-autonomous manner. The molecular basis of neurulation remains
  largely unknown, but we suggest that neurulation genes have evolved to
  work in concert with such determinants, so that appropriate changes occur
  in the behaviors of the correct populations of cells at the correct time,
  maximizing the efficiency of neurulation and leading to heritable species-
  and axial-differences in this process. In this article, we review the
  tissue and cellular basis of neurulation and provide strategies to
  determine its molecular basis. We expect that such strategies will lead to
  the identification in the near future of critical neurulation genes, genes
  that when mutated perturb neurulation in a highly specific and predictable
  fashion and cause neurulation defects, thereby contributing to the
  formation of neural tube defects. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Complex morphogenesis of surfaces: theory and experiment on coupling of
  reaction-diffusion patterning to growth
Harrison-LG; Wehner-S; Holloway-DM
FARADAY-DISCUSSIONS. 2001; 120 : 277-294

Reaction-diffusion theory for pattern formation is considered in relation
  to processes of biological development in which there is continuous growth
  and shape change as each new pattern forms. This is particularly common in
  the plant kingdom, for both unicellular and multicellular organisms. In
  addition to the feedbacks in the chemical dynamics, there is then another
  loop linking size and shape changes with the reaction-diffusion patterning
  of growth controllers in the growing region. In studies by computation,
  the codes must incorporate, alongside the usual solvers of the partial
  differential dynamic equations, a versatile growth code. to express any
  kind of shape change. We have found that regulation of shape change in
  particular ways (e.g. to make narrow-angle branchings) demands new
  features in our chemical mechanisms. Our growth algorithm is for a surface
  growing tangentially, but moving outward and changing shape to accommodate
  the extra area. This is potentially applicable both to the tunica layer of
  multicellular plant meristems and to the growing tip of the cell surface,
  e.g. in the morphogenesis of single-celled chlorophyte algae which display
  branching processes: whorl formation in Acetabularia (Dasycladales) and
  repeated dichotomous branching in Micrasterias (Desmidiaccae). For
  computational studies, a hemispherical shell is a reasonable idealization
  of the initial shape. We describe results of two types of study: (1)
  Pattern formation by three reaction-diffusion models, with contrasted
  nonlinearities, on the hemispherical shell, particularly to find
  conditions for robust formation of annular pattern or pattern for
  dichotomous branching, both of which are common in plants. (2) Sequential
  dichotomous branchings in a system growing and changing in shape from the
  hemispherical start.

Many intracellular components are present in low copy numbers per cell and
  subject to feedback control. We use chemical master equations to analyze a
  negative feedback system where species X  and S  regulate each other's
  synthesis with standard intracellular kinetics. For a given number of X 
  -molecules, S -variation can be significant. We show that this signal
  noise does not necessarily increase X -variation as previously thought
  but, surprisingly, can be necessary to reduce it below a Poissonian limit.
  The principle resembles Stochastic Resonance in that signal noise improves
  signal detection.

The regulation of tissue and organism size plays an essential, but poorly
  understood, role in multicellular development. Genes have been identified
  that affect body and organ size in a number of animals. Two recently
  identified genes, smIA and countin, are required for the proper function
  of a cell-counting mechanism that regulates organism size in the
  eukaryotic microorganism Dictyostelium discoideum. The discovery of this
  process now allows the study of size regulation in a simple multicellular
  system.

Self-organization of periodic patterns by dissociated feather mesenchymal
  cells and the regulation of size, number and spacing of primordia

Periodic patterning is a fundamental organizing process in biology. Using a
  feather reconstitution assay, we traced back to the initial stage of the
  patterning process. Cells started from an equivalent state and self
  -organized into a periodic pattern without previous cues or sequential
  propagation. When different numbers of dissociated mesenchymal cells were
  confronted with a piece of same-sized epithelium, the size of feather
  primordia remained constant, not the number or interbud spacing,
  suggesting size determination is intrinsic to dissociated cells,
  Increasing bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor expression in
  mesenchymal cells decreased the size of primordia while antagonizing the
  BMP pathway with Noggin increased the size of primordia. A threshold
  number of mesenchymal cells with a basal level of adhesion molecules such
  as NCAM were sufficient to trigger the patterning process. The process is
  best visualized by the progressive restriction of beta-catenin transcripts
  in the epidermis, Therefore, feather size, number and spacing are
  modulated through the available morphogen ligands and receptors in the
  system.

Fluctuation-induced diffusive instabilities

The formation of complex patterns in many non-equilibrium systems, ranging
  from solidifying alloys to multiphase flow, to nonlinear chemical
  reactions and the growth of bacterial colonies, involves the propagation
  of an interface that is unstable to diffusive motion. Most existing
  theoretical treatments of diffusive instabilities are based on-mean-field
  apploaches, such as the use of reaction-diffusion equations, that neglect
  the role of fluctuations. Here we show that finite fluctuations in
  particle number can be essential for such an instability to occur. We
  study, both analytically and with computer simulations, the planar
  interface separating different species in the simple two-component
  reaction A + B <chemical reaction> 2A (which can also serve as a simple
  model of bacterial growth in the presence of a nutrient). The interface
  displays markedly different dynamics within the reaction-diffusion
  treatment from that when fluctuations are taken into account. Our findings
  suggest that fluctuations can provide a new and general pattern-forming
  mechanism in non-equilibrium growth

A mechanistic model for morphogenesis and regeneration of limbs and
  imaginal discs.

Mechanisms-of-development
0925-4773
English
When an amphibian limb, cockroach leg or Drosophila imaginal disc is
  subjected to a surgical operation, it is capable of regenerating or
  duplicating certain parts. Although the structure of the regenerated
  tissue varies depending on the location and mass of the amputated or
  transplanted part, it can be predicted from a set of formal rules, called
  the polar coordinate model [French et al., (1976) Science 193, 969-983;
  Bryant et al., (1981) Science 212, 993-1002]. In the polar coordinate
  model, it is assumed (and experimentally proven) that the juxtaposition of
  normally non-adjacent cells stimulates cell proliferation locally, which
  implies that the underlying mechanism which gives positional values to
  each cell, is also responsible for the control of cell growth. Because
  locally activated proliferation alters the shape and size of the
  developmental field, the question of how to control the cell growth is the
  central problem in the regeneration of the limbs and imaginal discs. In
  this paper, I propose a possible underlying mechanism for the 'polar
  coordinate rules', and show how this mechanistic model explains the
  experimental results using computer simulation. The proposed mechanism is
  an extension of Turing's model (1952). In addition to the reaction
  -diffusion of the molecules, cell proliferation is taken into
  consideration. With appropriate initial conditions, the computer
  simulation shows that a small mass of cells grows up to form a mature
  limb, and that the mature limb is able to respond to surgical operations
  as predicted by the polar coordinate model.

A foot regeneration deficient strain of Hydra oligactis with altered size
  regulation was investigated. Analysis of the concentration of four
  morphogenetically active substances in Hydra oligactis showed that the
  foot regeneration deficiency was mainly due to a drastically reduced foot
  activator concentration. Foot activator was distributed as a very steep
  gradient in Hydra oligactis leading to a more severe impairment of foot
  regeneration the closer to the head cutting was done. The concentration of
  foot inhibitor was comparable, that of head activator slightly increased
  and that of head inhibitor reduced compared to Hydra vulgaris. Studies at
  the cellular level implied that the enlarged gastric region was due to an
  elevated level of inhibition hinting at a shift in the ratio between bound
  and free head inhibitor in this animal.

A fundamental problem in developmental biology concerns the proportioning

  two main models for positional information in pattern formation, the
  source-sink models and the Turing reaction-diffusion models, have
  shortcomings that limit their applicability. In a previous paper, we
  described a model that can produce perfectly scale-invariant spatial
  patterns and analyzed some of its mathematical properties. In the present
  paper, we demonstrate some of the shortcomings of the standard reaction
  -diffusion models and discuss the applicability of our model to
  developmental systems.

The cellular proportions in the dorsal-to-ventral, mesodermal sequence of

  with respect to embryo size. The dorsal, blastoporal lip serves as an
  organizer for this developmental sequence and the grafting of an
  additional organizer into a ventral location results in a symmetric
  pattern of cell types. A size-regulating, reaction-diffusion model is
  presented which produces positional information for development consistent
  with experimental observations in normal amphibian development and in the
  presence of an additional, ventrally-located, organizer region.

We have examined the behavior of two reaction-diffusion models, originally
  proposed by Gierer & Meinhardt (1972) and by Kauffman, Shymko & Trabert
  (1978), for biological pattern formation. Calculations are presented for
  pattern formation on a disc (approximating the geometry of a number of
  embryonic anlagen including the frog eye rudiment), emphasizing the
  sensitivity of patterns to changes in initial conditions and to
  perturbations in the geometry of the morphogen-producing space. Analysis
  of the linearized equations from the models enabled us to select
  appropriate parameters and disc size for pattern growth. A computer
  -implemented finite element method was used to solve the non-linear model
  equations reiteratively. For the Gierer-Meinhardt model, initial
  activation (varying in size over two orders of magnitude) of one point on
  the disc's edge was sufficient to generate the primary gradient. Various
  parts of the disc were removed (remaining only as diffusible space) from
  the morphogen-producing cycle to investigate the effects of cells dropping
  out of the cycle due to cell death or malfunction (single point removed)
  or differentiation (center removed), as occur in the Xenopus eye rudiment.
  The resulting patterns had the same general shape and amplitude as normal
  gradients. Nor did a two-fold increase in disc size affect the pattern
  -generating ability of the model. Disc fragments bearing their primary
  gradient patterns were fused (with gradients in opposite directions, but
  each parallel to the fusion line). The resulting patterns generated by the
  model showed many similarities to results of "compound eye" experiments in
  Xenopus. Similar patterns were obtained with the model of Kauffman's group
  (1978), but we found less stability of the pattern subject to simulations
  of central differentiation. However, removal of a single point from the
  morphogen cycle (cell death) did not result in any change. The sensitivity
  of the Kauffman et al. model to shape perturbations is not surprising
  since the model was originally designed to use shape and increasing size
  during growth to generate a sequence of transient patterns. However, the
  Gierer-Meinhardt model is remarkably stable even when subjected to a wide
  range of perturbations in the diffusible space, thus allowing it to cope
  with normal biological variability, and offering an exciting range of
  possibilities for reaction-diffusion models as mechanisms underlying the
  spatial patterns of tissue structures.

The relative sizes of the various structures in Hydra attenuata were

  ability to regulate proportions during regeneration. The three components
  of the head, namely hypostome, tentacles, and tentacle zone from which the
  tentacles emerge, the body column, and the basal disc were all measured
  separately. Ectodermal cell number was used as the measure of size. The
  results showed that the basal disc proportioned exactly over a 40-fold
  size range, and the tentacle tissue proportioned exactly over a 20-fold
  size range. In contrast, the hypostome and tentacle zone proportioned
  allometrically . With decreasing size, the hypostome and tentacle zone
  became an increasing fraction of the animal at the expense of body tissue,
  and in the very smallest regenerates at the expense of tentacle tissue. In
  their current form, the reaction-diffusion models proposed for pattern
  regulation in hydra are not consistent with the data.
