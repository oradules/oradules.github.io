Essentially all the biological functions of DNA depend on site-specific DNA
  -binding proteins finding their targets, and therefore 'searching' through
  megabases of non-target DNA. In this article, we review current
  understanding of how this sequence searching is done. We review how simple
  diffusion through solution may be unable to account for the rapid rates of
  association observed in experiments on some model systems, primarily the
  Lac repressor. We then present a simplified version of the 'facilitated
  diffusion' model of Berg, Winter and von Hippel, showing how non-specific
  DNA-protein interactions may account for accelerated targeting, by
  permitting the protein to sample many binding sites per DNA encounter. We
  discuss the 1-dimensional 'sliding' motion of protein along non-specific
  DNA, often proposed to be the mechanism of this multiple site sampling,
  and we discuss the role of short-range diffusive 'hopping' motions. We
  then derive the optimal range of sliding for a few physical situations,
  including simple models of chromosomes in vivo, showing that a sliding
  range of approximately 100 bp before dissociation optimizes targeting in
  vivo. Going beyond first-order binding kinetics, we discuss how
  processivity, the interaction of a protein with two or more targets on the
  same DNA, can reveal the extent of sliding and we review recent
  experiments studying processivity using the restriction enzyme EcoRV.
  Finally, we discuss how single molecule techniques might be used to study
  the dynamics of DNA site-specific targeting of proteins.

The enzymes that transcribe, recombine, package, and duplicate the
  eukaryotic genome all are highly processive and capable of generating
  large forces. Understanding chromosome function therefore will require
  analysis of mechanics as well as biochemistry. Here we review development
  of new biophysical-biochemical techniques for studying the mechanical
  properties of isolated chromatin fibers and chromosomes. We also discuss
  microscopy-based experiments on cells that visualize chromosome structure
  and dynamics. Experiments on chromatin tell us about its flexibility and
  fluctuation, as well as quantifying the forces generated during chromatin
  assembly. Experiments on whole chromosomes provide insight into the higher
  -order organization of chromatin; for example, recent experiments have
  shown that the mitotic chromosome is held together by isolated chromatin
  -chromatin links and not a large, mechanically contiguous non-DNA
  "scaffold".

We review micromechanical experiments studying mechanoelastic properties of
  mitotic chromosomes. We discuss the history of this field, starting from
  the classic in vivo experiments of Nicklas (1983). We then focus on
  experiments where chromosomes were extracted from prometaphase cells and
  then studied by micromanipulation and microfluidic biochemical techniques.
  These experiments reveal that chromosomes have a well-behaved elastic
  response over a fivefold range of stretching, with an elastic modulus
  similar to that of a loosely tethered polymer network. Perturbation by
  microfluidic "spraying" of various ions reveals that the mitotic
  chromosome can be rapidly and reversibly decondensed or overcondensed,
  i.e., that the native state is not maximally compacted. We compare our
  results for chromosomes from cells to results of experiments by
  Houchmandzadeh and Dimitrov (1999) on chromatids reconstituted using
  Xenopus egg extracts. Remarkably, while the stretching elastic response of
  reconstituted chromosomes is similar to that observed for chromosomes from
  cells, reconstituted chromosomes are far more easily bent. This result
  suggests that reconstituted chromatids have a large-scale structure that
  is quite different from chromosomes in somatic cells. Finally, we discuss
  microspraying experiments of DNA-cutting enzymes, which reveal that the
  element that gives mitotic chromosomes their mechanical integrity is DNA
  itself. These experiments indicate that chromatin-condensing proteins are
  not organized into a mechanically contiguous "scaffold," but instead that
  the mitotic chromosome is best thought of as a cross-linked network of
  chromatin. Preliminary results from restriction enzyme digestion
  experiments indicate a spacing between chromatin "cross-links" of roughly
  15 kb, a size similar to that inferred from classical chromatin loop
  isolation studies. These results suggest a general strategy for the use of
  micromanipulation methods for the study of chromosome structure.

Mitotic chromosomes are chromatin networks without a mechanically

Isolated newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) chromosomes were studied by using
  micromechanical force measurement during nuclease digestion. Micrococcal
  nuclease and short-recognition-sequence blunt-cutting restriction enzymes
  first remove the native elastic response of, and then to go on to
  completely disintegrate, single metaphase newt chromosomes. These
  experiments rule out the possibility that the mitotic chromosome is based
  on a mechanically contiguous internal non-DNA (e.g., protein) "scaffold";
  instead, the mechanical integrity of the metaphase chromosome is due to
  chromatin itself. Blunt-cutting restriction enzymes with longer
  recognition sequences only partially disassemble mitotic chromosomes and
  indicate that chromatin in metaphase chromosomes is constrained by
  isolated chromatin-crosslinking elements spaced by approximately 15 kb.

Dynamics of chromosome compaction during mitosis.

We have quantitatively studied the space-time dynamics of mitotic
  chromosome compaction in cultured amphibian cells. After collecting
  digital phase-contrast images we have done digital image analysis to study
  spatial correlations in density. We find a characteristic distance at
  which the strongest correlations occur, which provides a quantitative
  measure of the size of patches of dense chromatin during interphase and
  early prophase. Later in mitosis, this length corresponds to the thickness
  of prophase and metaphase chromosomes. We find that during interphase
  strong correlations exist at a few-micrometer length; during prophase this
  correlation length progressively drops as the chromosomes are compacted.
  Our data are explained by a model based on assembly of chromatin loops
  onto already fiberlike interphase chromosomes. To test this model we have
  microinjected cobalt hexamine trichloride into interphase nuclei and have
  observed the rapid condensation of the interphase chromatin into thick
  fibers with a spacing similar to the native-state interphase correlation
  length determined from our image analysis. (c) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

The bending rigidity of mitotic chromosomes.

The bending rigidities of mitotic chromosomes isolated from cultured N.
  viridescens (newt) and Xenopus epithelial cells were measured by observing
  their spontaneous thermal bending fluctuations. When combined with
  simultaneous measurement of stretching elasticity, these measurements
  constrain models for higher order mitotic chromosome structure. We
  measured bending rigidities of B approximately 10(-22) N. m(2) for newt
  and approximately 10(-23) N. m(2) for Xenopus chromosomes extracted from
  cells. A similar bending rigidity was measured for newt chromosomes in
  vivo by observing bending fluctuations in metaphase-arrested cells.
  Following each bending rigidity measurement, a stretching (Young's)
  modulus of the same chromosome was measured in the range of 10(2) to 10(3)
  Pa for newt and Xenopus chromosomes. For each chromosome, these values of
  B and Y are consistent with those expected for a simple elastic rod, B
  approximately YR(4), where R is the chromosome cross-section radius. Our
  measurements rule out the possibility that chromosome stretching and
  bending elasticity are principally due to a stiff central core region and
  are instead indicative of an internal structure, which is essentially
  homogeneous in its connectivity across the chromosome cross-section.

A polymer model for large-scale chromatin organization in lower eukaryotes.

A quantitative model of large-scale chromatin organization was applied to
  nuclei of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (meiotic prophase and G2
  phase), budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (young and senescent
  cells), Drosophila (embryonic cycles 10 and 14, and polytene tissues) and
  Caenorhabditis elegans (G1 phase). The model is based on the coil-like
  behavior of chromosomal fibers and the tight packing of discrete chromatin
  domains in a nucleus. Intrachromosomal domains are formed by chromatin
  anchoring to nuclear structures (e.g., the nuclear envelope). The observed
  sizes for confinement of chromatin diffusional motion are similar to the
  estimated sizes of corresponding domains. The model correctly predicts
  chromosome configurations (linear, Rabl, loop) and chromosome associations
  (homologous pairing, centromere and telomere clusters) on the basis of the
  geometrical constraints imposed by nuclear size and shape. Agreement
  between the model predictions and literature observations supports the
  notion that the average linear density of the 30-nm chromatin fiber is
  approximately 4 nucleosomes per 10 nm contour length.

Reversible hypercondensation and decondensation of mitotic chromosomes

We show that the chromatin in mitotic chromosomes can be drastically
  overcompacted or unfolded by temporary shifts in ion concentrations. By
  locally 'microspraying' reactants from micron-size pipettes, while
  simultaneously monitoring the size of and tension in single chromosomes,
  we are able to quantitatively study the dynamics of these reactions. The
  tension in a chromosome is monitored through observation and calibration
  of bending of the glass pipettes used to manipulate the chromosomes. For
  concentrations > 500 mM of NaCl and > 200 mM of MgCl2, we find that the
  initially applied tensions of approximately 500 pN relax to zero and that
  mitotic chromatin temporarily disperses in agreement with previous work
  (Maniotis et al. [1997] J. Cell. Biochem. 65:114-130). This unfolding
  occurs in about 1 s, and is reversible once the charge density is returned
  to physiological levels, if the exposure is not longer than approximately
  1 min. Low concentrations of NaCl (< 30 mM) also induces a decrease in
  tension and increase in size. We observe this swelling to be isotropic in
  experiments on chromosomes under zero tension, a behavior inconsistent
  with the existence of a well-defined central chromosome 'scaffold'. By
  contrast 10 mM of divalent cations (MgCl2 and CaCl2) induces an extremely
  rapid and reversible increase in tension and a reduction in the size of
  mitotic chromosomes. Hexaminecobalt trichloride (trivalent cation) has the
  same effect as MgCl2 and CaCl2, except the magnitude of force increase and
  size change are much larger. Hexaminecobalt trichloride reduces mitotic
  chromosomes to 65% of their original volume, indicating that at least 1/3
  of their apparent volume is aqueous solution. These results indicate that
  chromatin inside mitotic chromatids has a large amount of conformational
  freedom allowing dynamic unfolding and refolding and that charge
  interactions play a central role in maintaining mitotic chromosome
  structure. Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Probing chromosome structure with dynamic force relaxation

Physical-Review-Letters. 8 Jan. 2001; 86(2): 360-3
APS
We report measurements of the dynamics of force relaxation in single
  mitotic chromosomes, following step strains applied with micropipettes of
  force constant ~1 nN/ mu m. The force relaxes exponentially after an
  elongation (l/l/sub 0/) to less than 3* native length, with a relaxation
  time ~2 sec. This relaxation time corresponds to an effective viscosity
  ~10/sup 5/ times that of water. We experimentally rule out solvent flow
  into the chromosome as the mechanism for the relaxation time. Instead, the
  relaxation can be explained in terms of the disentanglement dynamics of
  ~80 kb chromatin loop domains.

The force-extension behavior of individual mitotic newt chromosomes was
  studied, using micropipette surgery and manipulation, for elongations up
  to 80 times native length. After elongations up to five times, chromosomes
  return to their native length. In this regime chromosomes have linear
  elasticity, requiring approximately 1 nN of force to be stretched to two
  times native length. After more than five times stretching, chromosomes
  are permanently elongated, with force hysteresis during relaxation. If a
  chromosome is repeatedly stretched to approximately 10 times native length
  and relaxed, a series of hysteresis loops are obtained that converge to a
  single reversible elastic response. For further elongations, the linear
  dependence of force on extension terminates at a force "plateau" of
  approximately 15-20 nN, near 30 times extension. After >30 times
  extensions, the elastic moduli of chromosomes can be reduced by more than
  20-fold, and they appear as "ghosts": swollen, elongated, and with reduced
  optical contrast under both phase and differential interference contrast
  imaging. Antibody labeling indicates that histone proteins are not being
  lost during even extreme extensions. Results are interpreted in terms of
  extension and failure of chromatin-tethering elements; the force data
  allow estimates of the number and size of such connectors in a chromosome.
